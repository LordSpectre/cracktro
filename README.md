INTRO CODED IN PYTHON BY KR0N0S IN MEMORY OF OLD CRACKTRO FROM THE '90s ... 
I would like to thank all the great scene groups who have inspired me with their amazing creations over the past 30 years. Thanks for everything, guys!

- Install Python on Windows. I used: python-3.13.1-amd64.exe
- Install dependencies: pip install pygame
- Execute the cracktro with: python cracktro.py
- That's it!

To compile the executable:
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data "assets/cracktro.xm;assets" --add-data "assets/kr0n0s.png;assets" --add-data "assets/logo.png;assets" cracktro.py
